## Areas for Development

### ELF and Command Line Support
- Expand command‑line option coverage for GNU ld and lld compatibility
- Improve and extend ELF feature support across embedded targets

### Linker Script Features and Compatibility
- Incrementally add GNU linker script keywords and semantics
- Improve compatibility to ease migration from existing toolchains

### Core Linker Capabilities
- LTO integration and performance improvements
- Backward compatibility with existing embedded workflows
- General linker optimizations focused on correctness and scalability

### Target Enablement
- Enable additional architectures and embedded targets
- Support target‑specific features while keeping the core generic

---

## Competitive Readiness and Usability

### Performance and Scalability
- Improve link‑time performance
- Reduce peak memory usage during linking
- Transparent comparisons with other linkers (code size, time, memory)

### User Experience and Diagnostics
- Clear, actionable diagnostics
- Improved reproducibility and supportability
- Richer and structured map file output

### DeepMap Integration
- Open‑source DeepMap for binary layout analysis
- GUI and command‑line interfaces

### Linker Plugin Ecosystem
- Stable and extensible plugin APIs
- Improved plugin diagnostics and observability
- Encourage open‑source plugin development

---

## Building Community Confidence

### Testing and Quality
- Open‑source CI workflows
- Public build and test dashboards

### Documentation
- Clear release notes
- Practical examples for embedded use cases

### Community Engagement
- Easy distribution and discoverability
- Participation in LLVM and embedded communities
- Conference talks, tutorials, and technical deep dives

### Legend

- **Status**: `TBD` (unknown / not yet validated), `Planned`, `In Progress`, `Done`
- **GNU ld / lld**: `TBD` (unknown), `Yes`, `No`, `Partial`
- **Reference**: link to upstream documentation (GNU ld manual / lld docs) or ELD docs

> **Note:** The tables below use `TBD` as the default to avoid overstating compatibility until verified.
